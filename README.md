## Content

### P1: Explore Weather Trends

Analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends of Victora, BC, Canada to overall global temperature trends.  Create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences.

### P2: Explore US Bikeshare Data

Make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Also, write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### P3: Investigate a Dataset

Analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. Use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to perform analysis and communicate results.

### P4: Analyze A/B Test Results

Understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
