## Content

### P1: Explore Weather Trends

Analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends of Victora, BC, Canada to overall global temperature trends.  Create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences.

### P2: Explore US Bikeshare Data

Make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Also, write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### P3: Investigate a Dataset

Analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. Use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to perform analysis and communicate results.

### P4: Analyze A/B Test Results

Understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### P5: Test of Perceptual Phenomenon

Investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. You will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. You will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, you will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.

### P6: Explore and Summarize Data

Conduct an exploratory data analysis and create an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of a data set.

### P7: Wrangle and Analyze Data

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. Document the wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

### P8: Create a Tableau Story

Create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. The final work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
